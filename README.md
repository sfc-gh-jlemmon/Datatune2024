# DataTune2024
## Building a Data Foundation from the Ground Up

Welcome to the Building a Data Foundation from the Ground Up with Snowflake session at DataTune 2024!  In this session, we will build a data platform from the ground up - the only prerequisites are an email address, a web browser, and interest in learning!  Using Snowflake, we will explore how to build a data warehouse, including data structures, ingesting data, building data pipelines, and doing some exploratory analytics.  With that foundation in place, you can "choose your own adventure" based on your interests: exploring data science/machine learning, analyzing geospatial data, or building user apps using Streamlit.

### About the Exercises
This lab will utilize [Snowflake Quickstarts] (https://quickstarts.snowflake.com) as the foundation for most of the exercises.  This serves multiple purposes:
- Quickstarts include full sample data and setup instructions for the exercises we'll be conducting
- You will have a primary reference you can use for a LONG time
- Quickstarts are frequently updated as new Snowflake features are released
- Snowflake **and its partners** are frequently adding new Quickstarts

> Put bluntly: outside of [Snowflake Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com), Quickstarts should be one of the __first__ places you check when you want to learn (or remember!) how to do something.

 ### Your Team
 This session is led by local Snowflakes, whose goals are to help you get comfortable using Snowflake as a platform, see what might be possible for everything from the simplest query through the most complex data science requirement, and generally share all the reasons we think Snowflake is an awesome platform.

We are all local to Nashville, and have varied experience in the data, cloud, and application spaces. We spend a lot of time connecting people and solving problems throughout Tennessee and the broader Southeast region.
